# devfolio
I specialize in distributed computing, machine learning, and mobile app development. My work has involved technologies like Apache Spark, Kubernetes, Docker, and Flutter, and I have contributed to several EU-funded projects focused on anomaly detection, safe routing, and predictive modeling. I'm constantly looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to innovative projects.
